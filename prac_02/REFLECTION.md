# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

75%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

Well, at home, a few days before the practical sessions  , the duration depends on the amount of videos that I have to go through.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

So, I noticed that I am now more consistent on listening to the materials in this subject so at least I know what I am doing in the practical seminars.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Very much need to get better at time management for me.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Not enough practising what I have learnt in this subject and that is what I need to change immediately, 
getting more hands-on experience with the language and understand how the whole thing works.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Well, here is the thing, I am doing good, not to say really well, so I can't say what it is specifically, I guess I have to 
move forward slowly and build my way up there.
